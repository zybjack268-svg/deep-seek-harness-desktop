/**
 * Restart-free installs: mount a freshly installed plugin into the running
 * composition through a market-owned Include subtree.
 *
 * Durable state stays with the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` (reconciled by
 * the dsh CLI at install time), so the next boot loads the plugin through the
 * normal bundle layer. The subtree here exists only for the current process:
 * its input files live under `<profile>/.dsh-market/` and are wiped on every
 * boot, so a crash can never leave a file that collides with the bundle layer
 * (inserting an id the bundle layer also inserts is a hard boot failure).
 * `state.json` in the same directory is the market's own durable state
 * (disable list + custom groups) and deliberately survives the wipe.
 *
 * The Include subclass suppresses `write()` — the loader otherwise persists
 * tree changes back to the file it read (see dsh's agent-presets PresetTree
 * for the in-tree precedent).
