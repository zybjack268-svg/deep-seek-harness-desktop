 *
 * Verified behavior matrix (2026-08, pnpm 9.15.9 / 10.28.2 / 11.21.0):
 * - workspace root, `add` without -w:  pnpm 9 fails ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT;
 *   pnpm 10/11 succeed.
 * - `add -w` where NO pnpm-workspace.yaml exists: ALL majors fail with
 *   "--workspace-root may only be used inside a workspace".
 * - modules dir built by pnpm 9, then pnpm 10/11 mutate it:
 *   ERR_PNPM_PUBLIC_HOIST_PATTERN_DIFF (defaults drifted between majors).
