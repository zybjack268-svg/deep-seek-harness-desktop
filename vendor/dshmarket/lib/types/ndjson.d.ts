/**
 * pnpm `--reporter=ndjson` progress parser (P1-6).
 *
 * pnpm's ndjson reporter is a bole stream on stdout: one JSON object per
 * line, e.g.
 *
 *   {"time":...,"level":"debug","name":"pnpm:stage","prefix":"...","stage":"resolution_started"}
 *   {"time":...,"level":"debug","name":"pnpm:progress","packageId":"...","status":"resolved"}
 *   {"time":...,"level":"debug","name":"pnpm:fetching-progress","packageId":"...","status":"started","size":123}
 *   {"time":...,"level":"debug","name":"pnpm:ignored-scripts","packageNames":["esbuild"]}
 *   {"time":...,"level":"error","name":"pnpm","err":{"message":"..."}}
 *
 * Verified against real pnpm 11.16.0 output (2026-08). Older pnpm majors
 * emit a different shape or nothing at all — callers fall back to human
 * line parsing when `seen` stays false.
 *
 * The reducer is pure and unit-testable: `feed` mutates the tracker's
 * internal snapshot, `snapshot` returns a serializable copy.
